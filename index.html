			<h2 id="main-h2">Welcome to my site. <br> Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>
			<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
			But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products,
			and they've become quite a hit.</p>
			<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures,
			stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all 
			things Halloween.</p>
			<h2 class="product-h2">Product of the week</h2>
			<img src="images/cat1.jpg" alt="Product of the week" width="120">
			<p><a href="Products/Cat.html" target="_blank">20" Deranged cat</a></p>
			<h3>My guarantee</h3>
			<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site,
			you can return it for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
